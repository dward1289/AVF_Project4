<p><b>What are the top selling app categories in the U.S.? Japan? Great Britain?</b></p> 

<ul>
<li>U.S. (<i>Games</i>): Angry Birds Star Wars</li>
<li>Japan (<i>Travel</i>): Norikae Annai</li>
<li>Great Britain (<i>Travel</i>): Atlas</li>
</ul> 

<p><b>Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</b></p> 
People want something to occupy their time, or they need to get somewhere. There will always be someone looking for a nice simple game to play to pass by time. People will always need directions to get to where they want to go. Especially in large areas like Japan, people will need a quick and easy way to get to their destination.
 
<p><b>What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?</b></p> 
 
<ul>
<li>U.S. 3.9 mbps $2.96</li>
<li>Japan 7.9 mbps $2.28</li>
<li>Great Britain 3.8 mbps $3.31</li>
</ul> 
<p>These results impact development because the application being created has to be able to function on many different bandwidths, and also be a reasonable price. You don't want the application to lag due to speed and you definitely don't want less users due to the cost. Those are two factors to think about when creating an application because those factors can determine how successful an application will be.</p>
 
<p><b>And, finally what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? feel free to have a first and second choice.</b></p> 
<p>In project topic I would choose productivity and for global market, I would start with U.S and  then branch out to Japan. I chose productivity because the applcation can be for anyone that may need a little more organization. After the application is doing well in the U.S. I would make it available to Japan and monitor its success there.</p>
