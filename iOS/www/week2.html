<p><b>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? <i>(Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance)</i></b></p> 
<p>I would remove the table tags and replace them with an unordered list. For all of my images that are displayed, I would add alt to them to give each image a name. That would make the images easier to be identified. The buttons that say, “Click Me”, would have a brief description of where this button will take the user, or what it will show.</p>

<p><b>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</p></b>
<p>The main feature that I find very frustrating is activating the accessibility features on mobile devices. On iOS devices, you would have to go to settings/general/accessibility, and then you have to select from the list which feature to activate that will best support your needs. I feel that is too much to do. Siri has been updated to open applications, bit she can’t do anything in the application. Some devices require downloading the software, and sometimes the software is very limited to what it can do. I would fix it by creating a button for hearing, vision, and touch. Each button would be displayed in settings. Once the user taps the button, the features will be enabled. That would cut down many steps a user would have to take to make their device easier for them to use.<p>

<p><b>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</p></b>
<p>Working in the Apple store, I have found that many people love the iPad because of the size. Some of its accessibility features include Assistive touch, which combines four features in to one onscreen button. VoiceOver is for vision impaired and reads everything on the screen for the user. 
Hearing aids are for the hearing impaired. It goes on the person’s ear like a Bluetooth. It isn’t always visible to the public eye, but it enhances sound, which allows the user to be able to hear well.</p>

<p><b>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.<p></b>
<p>iOS: VisualBraille Lite and SayText
Android: TalkBack and Voice Notify</p>
