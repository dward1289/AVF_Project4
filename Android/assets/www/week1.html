<p><b>Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include logins and payments. How could Twitter be used in these two scenarios?</b>  
In my application I would use the live data from Twitter to connect other users. When a user login to Twitter, the application will gain access to all of the followers and the users being followed. This will allow the user to share whatever may be going on in the application with others that are on Twitter. If someone would like to purchase extra content such as themes within my application, I would use Twitter to promote discounts. My application would invite the users to follow the application's page on Twitter to receive a theme for free, or a discount on an exclusive theme.</p>

<p><b>Visit Programmableweb.com and search for JSON-P data sources. Why would we need JSON-P, specifically?</b> 
Because JSON-P allows access to data that is outside of the application, which is what APIs basically do, it works well with JavaScript.  This means it is easy to convert into JavaScript and call the data to be displayed however it is meant to be displayed.</p>

<p><b>Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think might pair well with which types of Native device features?</b> 
Coderwall Profile API would pair well with the contacts. Creating a chatter with users that are in the contacts on the device would be a great way to share and talk about what may be going on in the application. Face.com API would work well with the camera because it recognizes faces in photos. A security lock application could use that API to enable a face recognition lock on the mobile device.</p>

<p><b>Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</b> 
I want my demo application to be easy to use and understand. I want the layout to be straight to the point. I want the design colors to be black, grey, red, and white because those will be my future company colors. I definitely want the components to function with Facebook and Twitter so that many people will use the application.</p>

<p><b>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</b>
I learned that if you try to work through a project without any breaks in between,  then the project will not come out to be what you expected. Not taking breaks will cause a lot of stress that is very unnecessary. I also learned to plan ahead when possible. Having a look at the future assignments can help you prepare for what's coming next. Creating a "to-do" list is also helpful and helps you keep track of what is due. Github is also very helpful when doing a project because you can track your progress and it allows others to view your work, so that they can give you pointers if needed. The main thing that I learned in design was that color makes a huge difference. If the colors are too dark, or too bright then the user may not enjoy using the application. Always think about how you felt when you saw an application that had color that was too bright, or too dark and how it made you feel.</p>
